Subject: [PATCH 016/100] input: Fix losing focus during re-attaching keyboard

Launch the weston-terminal and begin typing into it. Afterward, detach
and then re-attach the last keyboard. The keyboard focus is lost.

Call notify_keyboard_focus_out() when releasing the last keyboard to
save the keyboard focus, and try to restore it when attaching new
keyboard.
